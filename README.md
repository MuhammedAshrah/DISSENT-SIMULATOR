# 🗳️ DISSENT: Decision-making In Social Systems via Emergent Network Theory

> People don’t vote in silos. So why do our simulations treat them that way?

## What is DISSENT?

**DISSENT** is a Monte Carlo-based election simulation engine that challenges the traditional assumption of voter independence.

Most political science models simulate voters as isolated agents. But real-world voting behavior is social, networked, and influenced.

DISSENT fixes this by introducing **Emergent Network Theory (ENT)** — a tunable influence layer between demographic groups.

## ⚙️ Built Entirely From Scratch

- ✅ No political modeling libraries
- ✅ Raw `random.normalvariate()` for statistical noise
- ✅ Custom ENT influence dynamics
- ✅ Modular policy bundles + group weights
- ✅ Fully Monte Carlo simulated (100,000+ runs)

## 🧠 What DISSENT Models

| Module                     | Description                                                                 |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **ENT Alpha (0.0–1.0)**    | A tunable knob for how much groups influence each other                     |
| **Policy Collision**       | Competing policy preferences per voter (e.g. climate vs economy vs health) |
| **Dynamic Group Behavior** | Group preferences evolve via interaction, not demographics alone           |

## ✍️ Contribution & Philosophy

DISSENT was built entirely from scratch as an experimental thought-machine - not using any external libraries for voting, politics, or agent-based modeling. Every line of simulation logic, noise modeling, and influence dynamics was written ground-up to reimagine what it means to simulate decision-making in a connected society.

This project is more than code. It's a call to challenge our assumptions about how choices are made.
